        <h1 class="crossfit-heading">Top Traps Exercises : Your 45-Minutes Ultimate Traps Workout</h1>
        <p>A significant muscle group in the upper back is the trapezius muscles, commonly referred to as the "trap
            muscles." Exercises for building strength that focus on the trap muscles are called trap exercises. You may
            increase the size of your traps, correct your posture, and gain power for Olympic weightlifting movements
            like the deadlift with the help of these workouts.



            <br> <br> The neck, head, and shoulders can move thanks to the upper traps, which run from the base of the
            neck to the tops of the shoulders. Your midback's middle traps allow your shoulder blades to rotate
            (scapula). The lower traps are located between your shoulder blades and come together in the centre of your
            lower back to form a V-shape. The lower traps are in charge of supporting the spine and enabling torso
            flexion and rotation.

            <br> <br>
            You can develop larger trap muscles by engaging in trap exercises. One of the best techniques to improve
            back and shoulder hypertrophy is to practise trap exercises. For many bodybuilders, bigger trap muscles are
            not just a cosmetic goal; they also give them the strength they need to accomplish Olympic weightlifting
            movements like deadlifts.
            Exercises for the traps might help you stand more erect. It's important to maintain an upright posture while
            performing trap exercises by using your back and core muscles. Your stabiliser muscles will become stronger
            as a result, which will assist keep you from slouching.
            Neck pain can be lessened with stronger traps. Increasing the activity of your shoulder muscles through
            upper trapezius strengthening will help your head and neck receive greater support.

            <h1>1. Cable Shrugs</h1>
            <p>
                Position two cable handles as low as you can and stand with one handle in each hand.
                To raise the shoulders, inhale while tightening the traps. Firmly squeeze the handles at the top, then
                slowly lower them to their initial position.
                The appropriate number of times should be repeated.

                In order to better control the movement of the skull, traps may help you shrug while looking up a
                little. A ballistic movement could cause a neck injury, so this movement needs to be controlled and
                fluid.
                Program your accessory training properly since the traps often respond strongly to high repetitions and
                forceful movements (such as snatch grip high pulls).
                Squeezing the traps shouldn't cause the head to thrust forward significantly because this could put the
                neck in a vulnerable posture and cause harm.
                The mind-muscle connection can be improved by including a pause at the apex of the exercise.

            <h1>2. Dumbell Shrugs</h1>
            <p>Standing up, place the dumbbells on either side of your body.
                Step forward, take a deep breath, and take a neutral hold on the dumbbells.
                Make sure your spine is in a neutral position when you stand tall.
                To raise the shoulders, tighten the traps. At the top, squeeze firmly before slowly lowering the
                dumbbells to the initial position.
                The appropriate number of times should be repeated.
                In order to better control the movement of the skull, traps may help you shrug while looking up a
                little. A ballistic movement could cause a neck injury, so this movement needs to be controlled and
                fluid.
                Program your accessory training properly since the traps often respond strongly to high repetitions and
                forceful movements (such as snatch grip high pulls).
                Minimize the weight's momentum and any excessive jerking or bouncing. It doesn't matter how much you
                shrug.
                Squeezing the traps shouldn't cause the head to lean forward significantly because this puts the neck in
                danger of being injured.
                The mind-muscle connection can be improved by including a pause at the apex of the exercise.

            <h1>3. Rack Pull</h1>
            <p>
                Start with a weight that you can control for 2-4 sets of 5-10 repetitions when performing rack pulls.
                Choose a weight that enables you to continue using proper form for all sets and repetitions.

                Depending on your height, position a barbell in the squat rack at the proper height. Your knees should
                be just over the top of the barbell. To keep the barbell in place, use the pins on the squat rack.
                Hinge your hips back and slightly flex your knees to lower yourself towards the barbell while keeping
                your spine neutral. Your knees should be bent while keeping an upright shin position, and your feet
                should be hip-width apart.
                With an overhand grip that is little wider than your shoulders, take hold of the barbell.

                Your shoulders and hips should be just slightly apart. Throughout the movement, your chin should remain
                tucked, as if you were carrying an egg.

                To work your lats and upper back, turn your shoulders outward. To establish a sturdy position,
                distribute your weight evenly and firmly grasp the ground with your feet. Put some tension in your
                shoulders, hips, and core. This starting position should be used for all repetitions.
                Keep the barbell close to your body, keeping your spine neutral, and begin your upward movement by
                driving your feet through the floor. Squeeze your glutes and let your hips move forward as you start to
                rise up.

                Keep your arms long as your hips forward, then squeeze your glutes while keeping your spine in a neutral
                position. Your shoulders should finish squarely over your hips at the end of each repetition.

                Hinge from your hips and lower the barbell back to the squat rack pins carefully while keeping a neutral
                spine.
                The appropriate number of times should be repeated.

            <h1>4. EZ-Bar Upright Row</h1>
            <p>
                Check That Your Hands Aren't Too Close Together: Too near hand placement can lead to an increase in
                ulnar deviation. As you lift, widening your grip a little bit can help you avoid wrist injuries.

                You're Lifting Too Much Weight: If you're moving too much weight, you'll need to generate momentum.
                Excessive lifting will detract from the shoulders' appearance or, worse still, place excessive strain on
                them.

                Don't Lift The Bar Too High: Pushing the weight too high can raise your risk of suffering a shoulder
                impingement injury. You won't hurt yourself if you keep the height of your elbows the same as the height
                of your shoulders.

                Brace your midsection and maintain a straight back:
                During lifting, maintaining a solid core will aid in bracing and protecting the spine. By doing this,
                you'll be able to prevent the weight from swinging away from your centre of mass.

                Avoid rolling your shoulders forward. When you drop the weight, it's crucial to keep your chest up and
                your shoulders back.

            <h1>5. Upright Rows</h1>
            <p>
                One of the best workouts for developing the upper traps and shoulders is the barbell upright row. Put
                the desired amount of weight on a barbell and stand facing it with your feet about shoulder-width apart.
                Take an overhand grip on the barbell with your palms facing down and your hands just wider than shoulder
                width apart.
                By keeping your back straight and bending at the knees, pick up the bar.
                Lift the bar straight up as close to your body as you can while maintaining a straight back and
                forward-facing eyes (you should pull the bar up to around chest height - nearly touching your chin).
                After pausing, bring the bar slowly back to its starting position.
                Repeat as many times as needed.
