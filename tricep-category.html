        <h1 class="crossfit-heading">Top Tricep Exercises : Your 45-Minutes Ultimate Tricep Workout</h1>
        <p>Because many of the exercises isolate the triceps extremely specifically, you don't engage other muscle
            groups simultaneously, making tricep workouts distinct from conventional strength routines. This is the
            reason why people frequently prefer to exercise several muscle groups at the same time. But which muscle
            groups, in addition to your triceps, should you work out?

            Because the shoulders, chest, and triceps are all involved in many of the same functional motions, they are
            frequently trained with the triceps. Before working those muscle groups again, you should give them at least
            two days of rest.

            <br> <br> To target all three of the triceps' heads during an exercise, make sure you are targeting the
            entire muscle. Your strength will grow more evenly distributed the more diversity you can work into your
            regimen.

            When beginning a workout routine, try to complete three sets of 10–12 repetitions. You might be unsure of
            the ideal weight for your weights. For each exercise, aim for about 70% of the maximum weight you are
            capable of lifting. 3 When your fitness level improves, increase the weight and reps.

            <br> <br>
            Creating a triceps workout might enable you to develop functional mobility. Furthermore, developing other
            muscle groups requires strong triceps.  Push-ups and chest presses, for instance, require strong triceps.
            Here are some things to think about when organising a triceps workout.

            Before working on your triceps or any other strength-training exercise, you should warm up. It boosts the
            warmth of your muscles and gets blood circulating to them, both of which help prevent injury. Jumping jacks,
            callisthenics, or brisk walking can all serve as good warm-up exercises.

            <h1>1. Skullcrusher</h1>
            <p>
                If you've never done this exercise before, start with a little weight and focus on your form. You can
                gradually increase the weight you use as you get stronger and get more familiarity with the workout.

                Place the barbell on your lap as you sit on the bench.
                Hold the barbell with a grip that is shoulder-width apart, palms facing down, and wrists that are
                straight.
                As you raise the weight to a position over your collarbone, lie on your back.
                Slowly bend your elbows while keeping your shoulders steady to lower the weight to just over your head.
                As you reduce the weight, keep your elbows facing straight ahead.
                Keep for a few seconds. After that, press the weight back up to your shoulders while straightening your
                elbows.
                As you move, maintain your humerus bone's fixed position in space.

                3 sets of 8–12 repetitions should be performed.

            <h1>2. Close Grip Bench Press</h1>
            <p>
                Your feet should be on the ground, and your upper back should be touching the bench as you lay face-up
                on it. Just below the barbell, your eyes should be. Keep your neck and head in a neutral position.
                Throughout the movement, your chin should remain tucked, as if you were carrying an egg. While keeping
                your spine neutral, contract your glutes and core. Your shoulder blades ought to be a little bit back
                and down. Throughout the entire set, your upper back should remain stable and firmly in place.
                Grab the barbell with a grip that is shoulder-width apart, then turn your shoulders outward to work your
                lats.
                Lift the barbell off of the uprights while maintaining your alignment. Your wrists ought to be straight
                and parallel to your shoulders.
                Start each repeat from this location.

                Bend your elbows as you gradually start to descend the barbell towards the bottom of your chest.
                Reduce the weight until your upper arm is in close proximity to your body. The angle of your elbows
                should be 30 degrees.

                Stop for a brief moment at the bottom position.
                Contract your chest and start extending your elbows.
                At the peak of the exercise, contract your triceps and chest while keeping your elbows slightly bent.

            <p>A pair of dumbbells are needed to complete the standing dumbbell tricep extension, which is done while
                standing.

                Dumbbell tricep extensions while standing upright are a terrific technique to add resistance and up the
                ante on the intensity of your tricep workout.

                Dumbbell Tricep Extension While Standing
                Hold a dumbbell in both hands while maintaining a lofty stance and feet spaced shoulder-width apart.
                Your arms should be completely extended as you raise the dumbbell overhead.
                Keep your elbows close to your ears as you gradually drop the dumbbell behind your head.
                At the bottom of the action, take a brief pause before pressing the weight back up to the starting
                position.
                Repeat as many times as necessary while making sure to keep good form throughout the workout.</p>

            <h1>4. Push Down </h1>
            <p>Attach a straight or angled bar to a high pulley, then take hold with an overhand grip at shoulder width,
                palms facing down.
                Bring your upper arms near to your body and perpendicular to the floor while standing straight up with
                your torso straight and only a slight forward incline. While holding the bar, the forearms should be
                pointed upward towards the pulley. Your starting point is here.
                Bring the bar down with the help of your triceps until it rests against the front of your thighs and
                your arms are fully extended parallel to the floor. Only the forearms should ever move while the upper
                arms always stay still near to your body. While you make this motion, exhale.
                Bring the bar slowly back up to the starting position after a second hold in the contracted position.
                Inhale deeply as you complete this action.

                Repeat for the suggested number of times.

            <h1>5. Single Arm Dumbell Tricep Extension</h1>
            <p>
                Take a dumbbell and either stand up straight or sit on a utility bench with a back support while placing
                the dumbbells erect on top of your thighs.
                Dumbbell should be raised to shoulder height before being extended over the head so that the entire arm
                is parallel to the floor and adjacent to your head. You ought to be on top of the dumbbell. The second
                hand can be kept completely extended to the side while being supported at the waist, holding a stable
                object, or supporting the upper arm that is holding the dumbbell.
                Swivel your wrist so that the pinkie is pointing up and the palm of your hand is facing front.
                This will be where you start.

                With the upper arm still, gradually lower the dumbbell behind your head. As you carry out this exercise,
                inhale. When your triceps are fully extended, stop.
                Flexing your triceps as you exhale will bring you back to the starting position. Recommendation: Make
                sure that only the forearm moves. At all times, your upper arm should remain stationary adjacent to your
                head.

                Repeat with a different arm for the recommended number of repetitions.

            <h1>6. Both Arm Dumbell Tricep Extension</h1>
            <p>A version of the tricep extension workout that targets the triceps specifically is the standing dumbbell
                tricep extension.

                Exercises that target the long head of the triceps are particularly effective when done overhead. You'll
                look to have a bigger tricep overall if your long head is bigger and more dense.

                For individuals aiming for looks, triceps isolation exercises are especially helpful. They can also be
                beneficial for people who want to strengthen their pressing muscles in general.
                Choose the weight you want from the rack, then stand somewhere open.
                Lift the dumbbell to the top of your shoulder, take a deep breath, wrap your hands around it, and then
                press it above to get into position.
                Lock your elbows and carefully lower the dumbbell behind your head while maintaining an overlapped grip.
                Drive the dumbbell back to the beginning position by extending the elbows and flexing the triceps once
                your forearms have reached parallel or just below.
                The appropriate number of times should be repeated.

            <h1>7. Bench Reverse Dips</h1>
            <p>Place two benches (or chairs) side by side, spaced about two to three feet apart (depending on your height and length of your legs).
                Place your hands on the inside edge of one bench, shoulder width apart, with your fingers dangling over. Sit on the inner side of the bench.
                Extend your legs and position them in the middle of the second bench while maintaining a solid hold on the bench.
                Once you rise into the starting posture, fully extend your arms. Keep your head forward and your chest up.
                Keeping your posture upright, start slowly lowering your butt to the bottom position.
                Keep your elbows close to each other, your upper arms by your sides, and your back against the bench as you drop.


                When your elbow joint is at a 90-degree angle and your upper arms are parallel to the floor, stop and take a brief moment to breathe.
                Push yourself back up while maintaining your upright stance by focusing on your triceps.
                
                Once you finish the rep, squeeze your triceps as you push all the way back up and lock your elbows at the peak of the exercise.
                Repeat as many times as necessary.

                Keep your elbow at your side as you slowly stretch your arm downward until your forearm and hand are in contact with your upper thigh.
                
                After one count, squeeze your triceps, then raise yourself back up to the beginning position.

                To keep tension in your triceps, bend your elbows just a little bit.
                Slowly drop yourself as far as you can without touching the floor while maintaining a straight body.
                Without locking your elbows out, pause, and then push back up to the starting position.
