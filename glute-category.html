        <p>Kickboxing is a combat sport that combines elements of boxing with martial arts kicks.
            Training for kickboxing typically involves a combination of cardiovascular exercise, strength training, and
            technique practice. Fighters often use heavy bags, speed bags, and focus pads to improve their striking
            ability. They may also spar with partners to practice their techniques in a more realistic setting.

            <br> <br> Kickboxing has become increasingly popular as a fitness activity in recent years, with many gyms
            and fitness studios offering kickboxing classes. These classes typically focus on the fitness aspects of
            kickboxing rather than the combat aspects.

            <br> <br>
            Overall, kickboxing is a challenging and rewarding sport that requires both physical and mental toughness.
            Whether you are looking to compete or simply improve your fitness, kickboxing is a great way to challenge
            yourself and improve your overall health and well-being.

            <h1>1. Conventional Deadlift</h1>
            <p>Put the bar over your shoelaces and stand with your feet hip-width apart.
                As your torso approaches parallel to the floor, push your hips back and bend forward.
                Reach down and take the bar with a double overhand grip at shoulder width.

                Take a deep breath in, pull up on the bar just a little, and let your hips drop in a seesaw motion.
                Pulling the slack out of the bar is the term used to describe this process.
                Set the lats (imagine you're attempting to squeeze oranges in your armpits) and make sure your armpits
                are directly over the bar as you lower your hips and draw up on the bar.
                Drive through the entire foot and concentrate on removing the floor. As you stretch your knees and hips,
                make sure the bar tracks straight.
                After locking out your hips, you can reverse the motion by pushing your hips back and hinging forward.
                After the appropriate number of repetitions, lower the bar back to the floor, start over, and repeat.

            <h1>2. Back Squat</h1>
            <p>Prepare for the exercise by loading the barbell with the desired weight and raising it to just below
                shoulder height.
                Your feet should be around shoulder-width apart when you stand below the bar.
                Place the bar so that it rests on your top back muscles rather than the back of your neck. It should be
                cosy at the bar. Try padding the bar if that doesn't work.
                Now extend your hands behind your back and grasp the bar firmly with a wide grip.
                In order to lift the weight off the rack, you should now straighten your back and bend at the knees.Push
                up through the legs and remove the weight from the rack while maintaining a straight back and an upward
                gaze.

                Retract a few steps and centre yourself.
                When you carefully lower your body down, keep your eyes front. Don't slouch forward as you descend. Your
                buttocks should protrude and fall straight to the ground.

                Squat until your thighs are parallel to the ground, then slowly push through your heels to raise your
                body back up.
                When you rise up, avoid locking your knees out, and then repeat the motion.</p>

            <h1>3. Barbell Glute Bridge</h1>
            <p>
                Exercises for strengthening the glute muscles include the barbell glute bridge.

                Many weightlifters think that workouts like the squat and deadlift are all that are required to develop
                a full and strong pair of glutes. Yet this isn't entirely accurate. For appearance, usability, and
                strength, adding more glute isolation workouts like the barbell glute bridge is a good suggestion.
                Roll a barbell up to the area of your hips while standing up straight and extending your legs.
                Your arms should be holding on to the bar as you recline back onto the floor.
                By contracting your glutes and planting your heels firmly on the ground, you may raise your hips.
                After the necessary number of repetitions, lower your hips back to where they were at the beginning.

                and limb length).
                As your torso approaches parallel to the floor, push your hips back and bend forward.
                Reach down and take the bar with a double overhand grip at shoulder width.

            <h1>5. Modified Curtsy Lunge</h1>
            <p>Engage your core muscles, face front, keep your upper body standing tall, and keep your back straight
                while performing the curtsy lunge. While you lunge, take a deep breath and keep your front knee over
                your ankle. Maintain the toes pointed in the same direction as the knees while bending both knees until
                your calves and thighs form a 90-degree angle.
                The curtsy lunge is a modified lunge that uses several leg muscles while maintaining the lunge position.
                Together with the rest of your legs and glutes, this workout tones your inner and outer thighs. It's
                crucial to incorporate lateral movements into your leg workouts to engage multiple muscle groups, test
                your stability, and strengthen your entire core.
                Place your feet hip-width apart and stand tall.

                Take a large stride back with your left leg, crossing it behind your right leg, while maintaining your
                weight on your right foot.
                By bending your knees, begin lowering your body until your right thigh is parallel to the ground.
                Repeat on the other side, then go back to your starting position.

            <h1>6. Walking Lunge</h1>
            <p>
                A version of the static lunge exercise is the walking lunge. You "walk" ahead by lunging out with the
                second leg as opposed to standing back up straight after doing a lunge on one leg, as you would in a
                static bodyweight lunge. For a predetermined number of reps, the exercise continues.

                Walking lunges work the glutes, hips, and core as well as the legs. By adding weights or performing a
                walking lunge with a torso twist, you can also increase the difficulty of walking lunges.
                Put your feet shoulder-width apart and stand straight up. You can keep your hands on your hips or at
                your sides.
                Using your right leg, advance while placing weight on your heel.
                In a lunge position, flex the right knee and lower it until it is parallel to the floor. Take a brief
                pause.
                Repeat the exercise on the left leg, moving your left foot forward without moving your right leg. When
                your left leg is in a lunge position and parallel to the floor, pause.
                Continue this motion, alternating your legs as you lunge forward.
                10 to 12 repetitions per leg. Make two to three sets.

            <p>Connect a lower cable pulley to an ankle cuff.
                Place your right ankle in line with the cable pulley machine by standing in front of it at a distance of
                about 2 feet.
                To your right ankle, fasten the ankle cuff.
                Adjust the pulley machine to the required weight (it is preferable to start small and increase over
                time).
                To maintain your chest high, bend at the hips while holding the frame for support.
                Squeeze your glutes to bring your right leg backwards while keeping your core engaged and your knees
                slightly bent.
                To maintain balance, keep your left leg firmly planted.
                Bending at the knee, slowly bring your right leg back to the starting position.
                Repeat on your left leg after a certain number of repetitions.</p>

            <h1>8. Lateral Lunge</h1>
            <p>Stand with your feet hip-width apart and your knees slightly bent. With a neutral head and neck position,
                your shoulders should be precisely over your hips. As though holding an egg beneath your chin, your chin
                should stay tucked throughout the movement. The entire surface of each foot should bear the same amount
                of weight. Put your feet in a secure position by firmly grabbing the ground.
                Put your hands on the sides of your hips and tense your core, shoulders, and hips. From this position,
                start each repetition.
                Slowly take a large step to the side, shifting your bodyweight over your lead leg while keeping a
                neutral spine and an erect chest position.
                As soon as your foot touches the ground, sit your hips back and bend your hips and knees until your shin
                is in a fairly upright position. Your foot should be pointed forward, and your knee should end over your
                second and third toes. Lateral Lunge TWO of the MasterClassSEO

                Let your torso to advance over your bent leg as you recline into a lunge. Your forward-facing foot
                should be on the opposite leg, which should be straight. At the bottom, your pelvis should be in neutral
                alignment. Consider your pelvis to be a bucket full with water, and your goal is to keep the water from
                leaking out the front, back, or sides of the container.
                At the end of the movement, pause briefly.

                Keep your chest up as you push your full foot into the ground to start the upward movement, then push
                back up to a standing position with the help of your glute and quad.

                Once you return to the starting position, both legs should finish next to one another. Your shoulders
                should rest exactly over your hips when you finish each repetition.
                As many times as you'd want to, alternate with the other side.

            <h1>9. Leg Curl</h1>
            <p>The laying leg curl is a fantastic exercise for hamstring isolation. Choose the weight you wish to place on the stack, and then adjust the padding to fit your leg length, to get ready for the leg curl.
                Put your face down on the device. Just above the back of your ankles should be where the cushioning is placed. Adapt the length if it is higher than that.
                By removing a little of the weight from the stack, you can tighten your hamstrings. This is where the exercise will begin.
                Curl the weight up as high as you can while tightening your hamstrings.
                Firmly contract the hamstring, and then gradually return the weight to its starting position.
                Repeat as many times as needed.</p>
