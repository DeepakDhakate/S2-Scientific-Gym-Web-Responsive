            <h1>Barbell Deadlift</h1>
            <p>
                You will need a typical 45-pound barbell in order to perform a deadlift. To add weight, gradually add
                2.5–10 pounds to each side.

                Your level of fitness determines how much weight to use. Continue increasing the weight only once you
                have mastered the form to prevent an injury.

                How to perform a deadlift:

                Place your feet shoulder-width apart as you stance behind the barbell. Your feet ought to be virtually
                in contact with the bar.
                Maintain your back straight, your chest up, and slightly sink back into your hips. Grip the barbell
                while bending forward. Maintain an overhand grip with both hands facing down or with one palm looking up
                and the other facing down.
                Press your feet firmly into the ground while holding the bar, and bring your hips back.
                Push your hips forward into a standing position while maintaining a flat back. Finish by standing
                straight with your legs virtually locked out, shoulders back, and holding the bar with straight arms
                just below hip height.
                Keep your back straight, drive your hips back, bend your knees, and squat down until the bar is on the
                floor to return to the starting position.
                Rerun the activity. Depending on the amount of weight you're lifting, aim for 1-6 reps every set. Make
                3–5 sets.
            </p>

            <h1>Barbell Squats</h1>
            <p>
                Depending on your height, position a barbell in the squat rack at the proper height. The barbell ought
                to
                be just above your shoulders. After unracking the barbell, make sure you have room to take a few steps
                backward.
                Step underneath the barbell and set your hands on either side of it while facing the barbell. Your upper
                back muscles should support the weight of the barbell.
                Step backward until you're a few inches from the barbell rack, then unrack the weight.
                Maintain a tall stance with your feet slightly wider than hip-width apart and your knees slightly bent.
                Your head and neck should be in a neutral position, and your shoulders should be directly above your
                hips. As if keeping an egg beneath your chin, your chin should stay tucked the entire time.

                From toe to heel, evenly distribute your weight over your feet. To create a secure foot position, grip
                the ground with both of your feet.
                To work your lats and upper back, turn your shoulders outward.

                Put some tension in your shoulders, hips, and core. Your pelvis should be somewhat tucked in and your
                ribs should be down.
                Bend your hips, knees, and ankles to start the downward movement while keeping your alignment in place.
                Descend yourself until your legs are parallel to the floor or just slightly off-parallel. As you lower,
                keep your weight equally spread across your feet.
                Take a little pause at the bottom position. Pushing your feet into the ground will start the upward
                action that will get you standing. Keep your toes engaged and put more emphasis on pushing through your
                midfoot and heel.

                Keep your chest up as you start to stand up, tighten your glutes, allow your knees to straighten, and
                allow your hips to move forward.
                Squeeze your glutes and quads while keeping a neutral spine as you complete the exercise.

                Your shoulders should rest exactly over your hips when you finish each repetition.
                Consider your pelvis as a water-filled bucket, and your goal is to keep the water from dripping out the
                front, back, or sides.

            <h1>Kettlebell Swings</h1>
            <p>
                Place your feet little wider than shoulder width apart as you stand. Straightening your arms, hold a
                kettlebell in front of your body with both hands.
                Hinge at your hips and swing the kettlebell back through your legs while keeping your back straight and
                your knees slightly bent. Using that momentum, rise up and swing the kettlebell up to shoulder height in
                front of your body.
                As you stand up straight, drive your hips forward and tighten your core and glutes. Your knees should be
                straight and your glutes should be fully extended when the kettlebell reaches shoulder height.
                As you hinge at the hips, let the kettlebell swing back down through your legs. A rep is one.

            <h1>Box Jumps</h1>
            <p>
                With your feet hip-width apart and your arms lifted above your chest with your elbows slightly bent and
                your hands in front of your face, stand in front of a plyo box.

                Step onto the box with slightly bent knees while swinging your arms behind your body and pushing through
                the ground. At the same time, raise your arms back in front of your chest.

                With both feet softly touching the box, knees bent around 90 degrees, and chest held high. To straighten
                the legs and go back up to standing, push through the feet. Step one foot at a time off the box while
                lowering your arms to your sides.

            <h1>Treadmill Sprints</h1>
            <p>If you're a runner, there's a good chance you fall into one of two categories: either you're a
                cheetah-like sprinter who can run a 400-meter dash in a few seconds but can't jog farther than a
                5-kilometer distance, or you have the mentality that "slow and steady wins the race" and can complete a
                marathon without your legs giving out.

                And while you might be happy to stick to your favourite, you might be skipping out on some benefits to
                your health and exercise by doing so. In reality, mixing up your running routines (by including options
                like treadmill sprint workouts) can help you stay injury-free, achieve personal records, and become an
                all-around better and stronger athlete.
                Because of the way sprints influence the neuromuscular connections between your brain and your working
                muscles, even very long-distance runners can benefit from them, according to Laura Norris, an
                RRCA-certified running coach in Indiana. Sprinting teaches your body to move swiftly, which in turn
                prepares your brain to send commands to your muscles more quickly. So you're more effective when you're
                jogging at a slow pace, which is what most runners do for the most of their runs, she says.


                Sprint training offer advantages beyond simply developing quick feet and better running technique. "Your
                cardiovascular system is going to benefit greatly because it's kind of like a high-intensity interval
                training (HIIT) workout, with these hard bouts and extremely calm intervals," a Boston-based
                RRCA-certified running coach named Amanda Nurse continues, "from your heart rate getting pretty high for
                those sprints and recovering really slowly. She says, "That's going to help with your endurance and
                speed." (Plus, in case you didn't know, HIIT has some seriously amazing advantages.)



                One of the simplest ways to complete the task is to pound the belt. Treadmills enable you to exercise at
                any time, allowing you to keep consistency in your training programme, which in turn leads to
                development, according to Norris. Treadmill users are shielded from the ever-changing elements and
                cocooned in their own blissful bubble of sweat. Additionally, says Nurse, you may choose your precise
                pace and stick to it during the entire sprint.
