        <h1 class="crossfit-heading">Top Chest Exercises : Your 45-Minutes Ultimate Chest Workout</h1>
        <p>Humans have two main muscle groups that make up their chest: the pectoralis major and minor. The pectoralis
            major muscle, which is thick and makes up the majority of the chest muscles, is positioned above the
            pectoralis minor muscle, which is thin.

            <br> <br> Exercises for the chest are done to keep the body strong and healthy while also promoting the
            growth of the chest muscles. Because no special equipment is required and only the individual's own body
            weight is raised, push-ups are a terrific approach to work out the chest muscles.

            <br> <br>
            The upper body is kept in alignment and in a good position with the rest of the body by engaging the chest
            muscles. More strength is available for lifting, carrying, and other physical activities when the chest
            muscles are strong. Sports and athletic events benefit from having chest muscles that are both strong and
            flexible.

            <h1>1. Flat Bench Press or a Chest Press</h1>
            <p>On a flat bench, lie on your back. Hold a barbell with hands that are little broader than your shoulders.
                Above the shoulders, the bar should be placed directly.
                Keep your hips on the bench the entire time and plant your feet firmly into the ground.
                Throughout the activity, maintain a neutral spine position and keep your core engaged. Do not let your
                back arch.
                If using, remove the bar or dumbbells from the rack slowly. Allowing elbows to bend out to the side,
                about 45 degrees away from the torso, lower the bar to the chest, around nipple level.
                When your elbows are barely below the bench, stop lowering. Once you lift the bar back up to the
                starting position, plant your feet firmly on the ground.</p>
        </div>

            </div>
            <h1>2. Incline Bench Press</h1>
            <p>Lean back slightly so that your neutral spine rests against the bench and your feet are flat on the
                ground.
                To begin, place a barbell or dumbbells directly over your shoulders. Your palms should be facing front,
                with the thumb around the handle.
                With your elbows stretched to a 45-degree angle, press the weight up towards your eyebrows or slightly
                higher.
                Taking a deep breath, descend the dumbbells or barbell while keeping the elbows and wrists out to the
                sides, until they contact or reach just above the chest.
                Do at least five repetitions of the press repetitions. Remember that the number of reps depends on the
                weight and your goals. Less reps may be performed by someone using greater weights than by someone using
                lesser weights.</p>

            <h1>3. Flat Dumbbell Press</h1>
            <p> Get a pair of dumbbells, then sit on the bench with the weights in your hip crease. While still holding
                the dumbbells on your hips, recline back on the bench.
                After you're in position, tighten your abdominal muscles and raise the dumbbells to your chest. You
                should have your palms pointing forward. To activate your lats, turn your shoulders outward. Your upper
                back should continue to be stable and tight. This starting position should be used for all repetitions.
                Slowly lower the dumbbells until your upper arms are parallel to your back while keeping a neutral
                wrist. Your upper and lower arms should make a 90-degree angle, and your elbows should be placed 45
                degrees apart from your torso. At the bottom of the movement, pause.
                Squeeze your chest and start pushing the dumbbells back to the beginning position to start the upward
                movement. Keep pressing until your arms are long and your elbows are slightly bent.
                Squeezing your chest at the top will bring the movement to a close. At the conclusion of the exercise,
                keep your space between the dumbbells.</p>

            <h1>4. Incline Dumbbell Press</h1>
            <p>Sit on an inclined bench while holding two dumbbells, then gently lean back and raise your arms until
                they are above your head.
                Pull your shoulder blades into the bench while applying pressure through your feet to retract them. Your
                lower back should arch as a result, which aids to safeguard the shoulder joint.
                To unrack the barbell and hold it straight above you, take a deep breath in.
                Start the repetitions by lowering the dumbbells to just below mid-chest level, keeping your elbows
                tucked in rather than letting them flare outward. Lift the dumbbells until your arms are straight and
                they are in line with your chest by exerting pressure through your arms, chest, and feet.

            <p>Choose the machine's weight.
                On the platform, sit down. With your feet flat on the ground, firmly press your back on the platform's
                back.
                Take hold of the machine's handle with one hand in each. The pec deck could have a pad for resting,
                depending on the model. Put your forearms on each pad if that applies. Keep your elbows at chest level
                while bending your arms at a 90° angle.
                Pull your arms towards your body while tightening your pectoral muscles while holding the pec deck
                handles. Raise the handles or arm pads up to your chest, hold it there for a moment, and then gradually
                return to the beginning position.
                Repeat as many times as needed.</p>

            <h1>6. Cable Cross Over</h1>
            <p>Put the pulleys in a high position (over your head) and choose the desired resistance while holding one
                pulley in each hand to start.
                Pull your arms together in front of you and step in front of an imaginary straight line between the two
                pulleys. Your waist should be slightly bending forward as you move. This will be where you start.
                Extend your arms to the side (straight out at both sides) in a wide arc until you feel a stretch on your
                chest. Be sure to keep your elbows slightly bent to avoid stress at the biceps tendon. As you carry out
                this part of the action, inhale. Tip: Recognize this throughout the motion. The only joint that should
                move is the shoulder; the arms and torso should stay still.
                As you exhale, bring your arms back to their initial position. Use the same arc of motion that you did
                to lower the weights, if possible.
                Repeat the movement for the required number of repetitions, then pause for a moment in the beginning
                position.</p>

            <h1>7. Flat Bench Chest Fly</h1>
            <p>On a level, inclined bench, lie flat on your back. On either side of the seat, plant your feet firmly on
                the ground. For the entire workout, your head and back should be firmly pressed into the bench.
                The 2 dumbbells can be handed to you by a spotter, or you can carefully take them up off the ground and
                hold 1 in each hand.
                Raise your arms so that they are stretched but not locked out above your head. Your hands and dumbbells
                should be facing each other, and your elbows should be slightly bent.
                Take a deep breath in and descend the dumbbells in an arc motion until they are parallel to your chest.
                Although your arms won't be locked out, they will be out to the sides. Avoid lowering your arms below
                your shoulders.
                Taking a deep breath out, steadily press the dumbbells up in an arc motion.
                Do 10 to 15 repetitions. Rest. Total 3 sets.</p>

            <p>Put your back flat on a 30 degree-lowered inclination bench to begin. Each hand should be holding a
                dumbbell.
                Start by placing your arms at your sides, elbows bent and pointed out, at chest level.
                Lift your arms above your chest as you slowly exhale.
                Inhale, then slowly return to the beginning posture by lowering your arms to your sides.
                Keep pressing up.
                Do 10 to 15 repetitions. Make three sets.</p>

            </div>
            <h1>9. Pull Over with Dumbbells</h1>
            <p>Start with a weight for dumbbell pullovers that you are able to control for 2-3 sets of 10-15
                repetitions. Choose a weight that enables you to continue using proper form for all sets and
                repetitions.

                Sit on the bench with a dumbbell in your hand. The dumbbell should be held in an overhand grip.
                Remain relaxed on the seat. Push the dumbbell upward once you're in place. Your chest should be above
                the dumbbell. To activate your lats, turn your shoulders outward. Your upper back should remain firm and
                solid during the entire set. Long arms with a slight bend in the elbows are ideal. The direction of your
                elbows should be towards your legs. Maintain a neutral head and neck position while engaging your core. Throughout the movement, your chin should remain tucked, as if you were carrying an egg. This starting position should be used for all repetitions.
                Lower the dumbbell behind your head to begin the downward motion. When your chest and lats start to feel stretched, lower the dumbbell.
                At the bottom of the exercise, pause while keeping your chest and lats tight.
                Pull the dumbbell back to the beginning position by contracting your lats to start the upward movement.
                 Continue for the required number of times.</p>
