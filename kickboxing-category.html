        <h1 class="crossfit-heading">5 Kickboxing Moves: Your 45-Minutes Ultimate Workout</h1>
        <p>Kickboxing is a combat sport that combines elements of boxing with martial arts kicks.
            Training for kickboxing typically involves a combination of cardiovascular exercise, strength training, and
            technique practice. Fighters often use heavy bags, speed bags, and focus pads to improve their striking
            ability. They may also spar with partners to practice their techniques in a more realistic setting.

            <br> <br> Kickboxing has become increasingly popular as a fitness activity in recent years, with many gyms
            and fitness studios offering kickboxing classes. These classes typically focus on the fitness aspects of
            kickboxing rather than the combat aspects.

            <br> <br>
            Overall, kickboxing is a challenging and rewarding sport that requires both physical and mental toughness.
            Whether you are looking to compete or simply improve your fitness, kickboxing is a great way to challenge
            yourself and improve your overall health and well-being.

            <h1>1. Jab, Cross, Hook, Uppercut</h1>
            <p>Jab:
                Start off in a boxing stance with your feet staggered and slightly wider than shoulder-width apart, your
                left foot in front, and your fists covering your face (if left-handed, step right foot in front).

                Leaning forward with your left foot, extend your left arm with control, palm facing down (if
                left-handed, jab with right hand). Step back quickly and return the left (or right) arm to its initial
                position.
                <br>
                <br>
                Cross:Start off in a boxing stance with your feet staggered and slightly wider than shoulder-width
                apart, your left foot in front, and your fists covering your face (if left-handed, step right foot in
                front).

                Right foot pivot as the right hip rotates forward and the heel of the right foot leaves the ground. Move
                your weight forward, extend your right arm, and prepare to punch while turning your palm downward. Right
                fist back to face quickly. (Again, if left-handed, the opposite will apply.)

                <br>
                <br>
                Hook:Start off in a boxing stance with your feet staggered and slightly wider than shoulder-width apart,
                your left foot in front, and your fists covering your face (if left-handed, step right foot in front).

                Swing left arm at a 90-degree angle as though you were going to hit someone in the jaw. Make a
                right-facing knee and hip pivot. (Lefties, swing your right arm to the left.)

                To throw a rear-hand hook, swivel your back heel when punching (right hand for righties; left for
                lefties).

                <br>
                <br>
                Uppercut:Start off in a boxing stance with your feet staggered and slightly wider than shoulder-width
                apart, your left foot in front, and your fists covering your face (if left-handed, step right foot in
                front).

                B. Swing and loop your right hand up as if you were punching an opponent in the chin by rotating your
                right hip forward, pivoting on the ball of your right foot. With the left hand, support the chin during
                the motion. (Lefties, change your course!) The lead hand, which is the left hand for righties and the
                right hand for lefties, should not pivot when delivering an uppercut.

            <h1>2. Sweep, Squat, Kick</h1>
            <p>
                The sweep squat is a novel variation on the standard squat that works additional gluteal and quadriceps
                muscles. Garcia claims that including the kick also activates your hamstrings. The sweep down activates
                the core a little bit more, which is a fantastic plus in this motion.

                How to: Place your feet shoulder-width apart in the guard position (a). Maintaining your hands by your
                cheekbones, squat deeply (b). Kick your right leg straight out as you rise from the squat and sweep your
                arms laterally to your left side (c). On the left, repeat (d). One rep equals this.
            </p>
        </div>


        <div class="crossfit-container">
            <div class="crossfit-img-data">

            </div>
            <h1>3. Jab, Cross, Slip</h1>
            <p>
                The key to this move is solid offence and defence. Garcia advises to move into the punch in this
                instance, then defensively retreat and duck away from a potential blow from a third party.

                Get into the guard position. Standing with your feet shoulder-width apart and your forward facing (a).
                Your thumb is pointing down as you straighten out your left fist. Reposition your fist in the guard
                position (b). Punch with your right fist extended straight ahead and your thumb pointed at the ground,
                bringing your right hip and shoulder forward. Back it up to the guard position (c). Maintaining the
                guard position with your hands, kneel down while ducking your head to your right side (d). On the left,
                repeat. One rep equals this.
            </p>
        </div>


        <div class="crossfit-container">
            <div class="crossfit-img-data">
                <!-- <img src="img/box-jump.jpg" alt=""> -->
            </div>
            <h1>4. Front Kick, Back Kick</h1>
            <p>When doing this combination of kicks, control is crucial. Your hips and hamstrings also need to be flexible and mobile. Garcia advises kicking low at knee height and working your way up to hip or chest height.

                How to: Take a guard stance with your feet in a staggered fighting stance, hands at your cheekbones (a). Keeping your upper body in proper alignment, kick your right leg forward before kicking your left leg back (b). One rep equals this.</p>
        </div>

            <div class="crossfit-img-data">
                <!-- <img id="sprint" src="img/inclined-treadmill.gif" alt=""> -->
            </div>
            <h1>5. Uppercuts</h1>
            <p>Uppercuts appear to be lower body movements. Your shoulders, back, and legs also contribute to the real force behind them. Kickboxing becomes a full-body exercise by "firing up these enormous burners," according to Garcia.

                How to: Place your feet shoulder-width apart while standing (a). Your right hip and shoulder should move forward (b). Punch up with your fists while maintaining your elbow position. Aim your thumbs towards you (c). One rep is right, then left.
